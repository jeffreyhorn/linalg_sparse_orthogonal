# Algorithm Description

## Orthogonal Linked-List Data Structure

The library stores sparse matrices in an **orthogonal linked-list** (also called a cross-linked list) representation. Each non-zero entry is a `Node` containing:

```
struct Node {
    idx_t   row, col;     // physical position
    double  value;
    Node   *right;        // next non-zero in this row (by column)
    Node   *down;         // next non-zero in this column (by row)
};
```

Each node belongs to two sorted linked lists simultaneously:
- A **row list** linking all non-zeros in the same row, sorted by column index
- A **column list** linking all non-zeros in the same column, sorted by row index

The matrix struct maintains header arrays `row_headers[0..m-1]` and `col_headers[0..n-1]` pointing to the first node in each row/column list.

### Advantages

- **Efficient row and column traversal** — both are O(nnz_row) or O(nnz_col)
- **Efficient element insertion and deletion** — O(nnz_row + nnz_col) worst case
- **Natural for LU factorization** — elimination needs both row and column access
- **No reallocation on fill-in** — new nodes are allocated from the pool

### Trade-offs

- Higher per-element overhead than CSR/CSC (two pointers per node vs. one index)
- Pointer chasing limits cache performance for SpMV compared to compressed formats
- Not suitable for extremely large matrices where CSR/CSC memory density matters

## Memory Management: Slab Pool Allocator

Nodes are allocated from a slab pool with a free-list:

1. **Slabs**: Fixed-size arrays of `NODES_PER_SLAB` (default 4096) nodes, allocated via `malloc` and chained together.

2. **Allocation**: `pool_alloc()` first checks the free-list; if empty, it bumps the `used` counter in the current slab; if the slab is full, a new slab is allocated.

3. **Deallocation**: `pool_release()` pushes the node onto the free-list (using the `right` pointer as the free-list link). The node is not zeroed — it is simply reused on the next allocation.

4. **Bulk free**: `pool_free_all()` walks the slab chain and frees each slab. Called by `sparse_free()`.

This design avoids per-node `malloc`/`free` calls, which is critical during LU factorization where thousands of nodes may be created and destroyed.

## Permutation Arrays

The matrix maintains four permutation arrays of length n (for square matrices):

| Array | Mapping | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `row_perm[i]` | logical row i → physical row | Encodes P in P·A·Q = L·U |
| `inv_row_perm[j]` | physical row j → logical row | Inverse of row_perm |
| `col_perm[i]` | logical col i → physical col | Encodes Q in P·A·Q = L·U |
| `inv_col_perm[j]` | physical col j → logical col | Inverse of col_perm |

Invariant: `row_perm[inv_row_perm[j]] == j` and `inv_row_perm[row_perm[i]] == i` for all i, j.

Initially all permutations are the identity. During LU factorization, pivoting swaps entries in these arrays.

## LU Factorization Algorithm

The factorization computes P·A·Q = L·U where:
- P is a row permutation (always applied)
- Q is a column permutation (identity for partial pivoting, non-trivial for complete pivoting)
- L is unit lower triangular (1s on diagonal, stored below diagonal)
- U is upper triangular (stored on and above diagonal)

### Pseudocode

```
for k = 0 to n-1:
    // 1. Pivot selection
    if COMPLETE pivoting:
        find (p, q) = argmax |A(i, j)| for i >= k, j >= k  (in logical space)
        swap logical rows k ↔ p
        swap logical cols k ↔ q
    else (PARTIAL pivoting):
        find p = argmax |A(i, k)| for i >= k  (in logical space, column k only)
        swap logical rows k ↔ p

    // 2. Check pivot
    pivot = A(k, k)   // logical (k,k) = physical (row_perm[k], col_perm[k])
    if |pivot| < tol:
        return SINGULAR

    // 3. Snapshot: collect physical row indices that need elimination
    snapshot = [physical rows in column col_perm[k] with logical row > k]

    // 4. Elimination
    for each physical row pr in snapshot:
        logical_row = inv_row_perm[pr]
        multiplier = A(logical_row, k) / pivot
        A(logical_row, k) = multiplier       // store L entry

        // Subtract multiplier * (pivot row) from this row
        for each entry (k, j) in logical pivot row where j > k:
            A(logical_row, j) -= multiplier * A(k, j)
            // Drop if |value| < DROP_TOL * |pivot|
```

### Snapshot Mechanism (Bug 3.1 Fix)

The elimination loop modifies entries in the pivot column, which changes the column list being traversed. To avoid corrupted traversal, the algorithm **snapshots** all physical row indices that need elimination before the loop begins. This is stored in a temporary array allocated once and reused for each pivot step.

### Forward Substitution (Bug 3.3 Fix)

Forward substitution solves L·y = b where L is unit lower triangular:

```
for i = 0 to n-1:
    y[i] = b[i]
    // Walk entire row i, accumulating L entries where col < i
    for each entry (i, j) in logical row i:
        if j < i:
            y[i] -= L(i, j) * y[j]
```

The key fix: the row is traversed completely without early termination. In the orthogonal list, entries are stored in physical column order, which may not correspond to logical column order after pivoting. An early `break` on `j >= i` would miss L entries stored after U entries in the physical list.

## Solve Procedure

Given the factored matrix (containing L and U) with permutations P and Q:

```
Solve A*x = b:
    1. pb = P * b              // pb[i] = b[row_perm[i]]
    2. Solve L * y = pb        // forward substitution
    3. Solve U * z = y         // backward substitution
    4. x = Q * z               // x[i] = z[inv_col_perm[i]]
```

Step 4 uses `inv_col_perm` (not `col_perm`) because Q maps logical to physical columns, and we need the inverse to go from the factored column space back to the original.

## Iterative Refinement

Given the original matrix A, the LU factorization, and an initial solution x:

```
for iter = 1 to max_iters:
    r = b - A * x              // residual (using original A, not LU)
    if ||r|| / ||b|| < tol:
        break
    Solve A * d = r using LU   // correction
    x = x + d                  // update
```

This exploits the fact that the LU factorization can be reused for multiple solves. The SpMV with the original matrix provides a more accurate residual than working with the L and U factors.

## Complexity Analysis

### Space

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Node storage | 2 × sizeof(pointer) + sizeof(double) + 2 × sizeof(idx_t) per non-zero ≈ 32 bytes/nnz |
| Row/column headers | 2 × n × sizeof(pointer) |
| Permutation arrays | 4 × n × sizeof(idx_t) |
| Pool slabs | Rounded up to NODES_PER_SLAB granularity |

### Time

| Operation | Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Insert/remove | O(nnz_row + nnz_col) | List traversal to find position |
| Get (physical) | O(nnz_row) | Row list scan |
| SpMV (y = A*x) | O(nnz) | One pass over all entries |
| LU factor (partial) | O(nnz × n) worst case | Depends on fill-in; O(nnz) for banded |
| LU factor (complete) | O(n^2 × nnz) worst case | Submatrix search at each step |
| Forward/backward sub | O(nnz_LU) | Traversal of L or U entries |
| Iterative refinement | O(k × (nnz + nnz_LU)) | k iterations, one SpMV + one solve each |

### Fill-in Behavior

Fill-in during LU factorization depends heavily on matrix structure and pivoting:

| Matrix type | Partial pivoting fill-in | Complete pivoting fill-in |
|-------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Tridiagonal | 1.0x (no fill-in) | ~1.6x |
| Pentadiagonal | ~1.5x | ~2-3x |
| Arrow | Catastrophic (→ 100% dense) | Catastrophic |
| Random sparse (k=5/row) | ~2-5x | ~3-8x |

Fill-reducing reordering (AMD, RCM) is available — see the **Fill-Reducing Reordering** section below.

## Drop Tolerance

During elimination, new fill-in entries with |value| < DROP_TOL × |pivot| are dropped (not inserted). This controls memory growth at the expense of factorization accuracy. The default DROP_TOL of 1e-14 is conservative — it drops only entries that are negligible relative to the pivot, preserving near-exact arithmetic.

For matrices where fill-in is a concern, a larger drop tolerance (e.g., 1e-8) can significantly reduce memory usage while maintaining acceptable accuracy, especially when followed by iterative refinement.

## Singularity Detection: Relative Tolerance

Backward substitution checks each diagonal element U(i,i) for near-zero values before dividing. This check uses a **relative** threshold:

```
threshold = DROP_TOL × ||A||_inf
```

where `||A||_inf` is the infinity norm (maximum absolute row sum) of the original matrix, computed and cached during `sparse_lu_factor()`.

### Why Relative?

An absolute threshold (the previous approach, using bare `DROP_TOL = 1e-14`) fails for two classes of matrices:

1. **Matrices with uniformly small entries** — e.g., `A = 1e-16 × I`. Every diagonal entry is `1e-16`, which is smaller than `1e-14`, causing a false singular detection even though the matrix is perfectly well-conditioned (condition number = 1).

2. **Matrices with very large entries** — e.g., diagonal entries of `1e15`. With an absolute threshold, even a near-zero diagonal entry like `1e-10` would pass, even though it represents catastrophic loss of significance relative to the matrix scale.

The relative threshold `DROP_TOL × ||A||_inf` scales with the matrix, so:
- A `1e-16 × I` matrix has threshold `1e-14 × 1e-16 = 1e-30`, correctly allowing `1e-16` pivots.
- A matrix with `||A||_inf = 1e15` has threshold `1e-14 × 1e15 = 10`, correctly rejecting pivots smaller than 10.

### Fallback

If `factor_norm` is not set (e.g., backward substitution is called on a matrix that was not factored via `sparse_lu_factor`), the absolute `DROP_TOL` is used as a fallback for backward compatibility.

## Cholesky Factorization

For symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices, Cholesky factorization computes A = L·L^T where L is lower triangular. This exploits symmetry for approximately half the storage and computation of LU.

### Algorithm (left-looking, column-by-column)

```
for k = 0 to n-1:
    L(k,k) = sqrt( A(k,k) - sum_{j<k} L(k,j)^2 )
    if L(k,k) <= 0: return NOT_SPD

    for each i > k with nonzero A(i,k) or fill-in:
        L(i,k) = ( A(i,k) - sum_{j<k} L(i,j)*L(k,j) ) / L(k,k)
```

A dense column accumulator is used for each column k to efficiently handle fill-in. After accumulating contributions from previous columns, nonzero entries are written back to the sparse structure.

### Advantages over LU for SPD matrices

- **No pivoting needed** — SPD guarantees all pivots are positive
- **Half the storage** — only L is stored (not both L and U)
- **Half the computation** — symmetry halves the work
- **Better numerical stability** — no need for pivot search or permutation

### Complexity

| Operation | Complexity |
|-----------|-----------|
| Cholesky factor | O(nnz_L × avg_col_nnz) |
| Cholesky solve | O(nnz_L) forward + O(nnz_L) backward |

### Fill-in comparison (SuiteSparse, no reordering)

| Matrix | LU nnz | Cholesky nnz | Savings |
|--------|-------:|---------:|---------|
| nos4 (100×100) | 1510 | 805 | 47% |
| bcsstk04 (132×132) | 8581 | 3664 | 57% |

## Condition Number Estimation

`sparse_lu_condest()` estimates the 1-norm condition number `κ₁(A) = ‖A‖₁ · ‖A⁻¹‖₁` using the Hager/Higham algorithm (Hager 1984, Higham 2000).

### Algorithm

The key insight is that `‖A⁻¹‖₁` can be estimated without forming the inverse, using only forward and transpose solves with the existing LU factors:

```
1. x = [1/n, ..., 1/n]
2. Solve A·w = x
3. ξ = sign(w)
4. Solve Aᵀ·z = ξ
5. If ‖z‖∞ ≤ zᵀ·w: converged, ‖A⁻¹‖₁ ≈ ‖w‖₁
6. Otherwise: x = eⱼ where j = argmax|zⱼ|, go to 2
7. Max 5 iterations
```

The transpose solve (`Aᵀ·z = b`) is implemented by reversing the order of operations: forward-substitute with Uᵀ (using column lists), backward-substitute with Lᵀ (unit diagonal), with appropriate permutation handling.

### Limitations

- The estimate is a lower bound on the true condition number (may underestimate)
- Typically accurate to within a factor of 3-10
- Requires both the original matrix A (for `‖A‖₁`) and the LU factors

## Fill-Reducing Reordering

Before LU factorization, a symmetric permutation P·A·Pᵀ can dramatically reduce fill-in. Two algorithms are provided:

### Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM)

BFS-based bandwidth reduction on the symmetrized adjacency graph (A + Aᵀ).

**Algorithm:**
1. Find a pseudo-peripheral starting node (repeated BFS heuristic)
2. BFS visiting neighbors in order of increasing degree
3. Reverse the resulting ordering

**Characteristics:**
- O(nnz · log d_max) time (includes neighbor sorting during graph construction and BFS)
- Best for banded/structured matrices (e.g., FEM meshes, thermal problems)
- On steam1 (240×240 thermal): bandwidth 146→52, fill-in 23k→15k (33% reduction), 5.5x factorization speedup

### Approximate Minimum Degree (AMD)

Greedy elimination ordering using bitset adjacency for efficient set operations.

**Algorithm:**
1. Build bitset adjacency matrix from the symmetrized sparsity pattern
2. At each step: eliminate the uneliminated node with smallest degree
3. Merge eliminated node's neighbors' adjacency sets (models fill-in)
4. Update degrees

**Characteristics:**
- O(n² · n/64) time with bitset operations
- Generally better fill-in reduction for unstructured matrices
- On orsirr_1 (1030×1030 oil reservoir): fill-in 78k→55k (29% reduction)
- On nos4 (100×100 structural): fill-in 1510→1174 (22% reduction)

### Integration with Factorization

The `sparse_lu_factor_opts()` function provides a unified interface:

```c
sparse_lu_opts_t opts = { SPARSE_PIVOT_PARTIAL, SPARSE_REORDER_AMD, 1e-12 };
sparse_lu_factor_opts(LU, &opts);
sparse_lu_solve(LU, b, x);  // reorder/unpermute handled automatically
```

The reordering permutation is stored in the matrix and automatically applied during solve — callers do not need to manually permute/unpermute vectors.

Similarly for Cholesky:

```c
sparse_cholesky_opts_t opts = { SPARSE_REORDER_AMD };
sparse_cholesky_factor_opts(L, &opts);
sparse_cholesky_solve(L, b, x);  // reorder/unpermute handled automatically
```

## Sparse Matrix-Matrix Multiply (SpMM)

`sparse_matmul(A, B, &C)` computes C = A*B using Gustavson's row-wise algorithm.

### Algorithm

```
for each row i of A:
    initialize dense accumulator acc[0..n-1] = 0
    for each nonzero A(i,j):
        acc += A(i,j) * row_j(B)
    flush nonzeros from acc into row i of C
```

The dense accumulator avoids hash-based or sort-based merging. Entries with |value| < 1e-15 are dropped during flush to avoid storing numerical zeros from cancellation.

### Complexity

- Time: O(nnz_A × avg_nnz_per_row_B + nnz_C) where the second term is the total flush cost over all rows
- Space: O(n) for the dense accumulator and touched-index list (reused per row)
- The flush step iterates only columns touched during accumulation (via a compact index list), not all n columns.

## CSR/CSC Compressed Formats

The library provides bidirectional conversion between the orthogonal linked-list format and standard compressed sparse formats.

### CSR (Compressed Sparse Row)

```
row_ptr[i] .. row_ptr[i+1]-1  →  indices into col_idx/values for row i
```

- `sparse_to_csr()`: walks each row's linked list (already sorted by column) — O(nnz)
- `sparse_from_csr()`: validates structure then inserts entries — O(nnz × avg_row_nnz) due to per-insert row-list scan

### CSC (Compressed Sparse Column)

```
col_ptr[j] .. col_ptr[j+1]-1  →  indices into row_idx/values for column j
```

- `sparse_to_csc()`: walks each column's linked list (already sorted by row) — O(nnz)
- `sparse_from_csc()`: validates structure then inserts entries — O(nnz × avg_row_nnz) due to per-insert row-list scan

### Transpose Relationship

CSR of A has the same structure as CSC of A^T. This means `sparse_to_csr(A)` produces arrays identical to `sparse_to_csc(A^T)`.

## Thread Safety

The library is safe for concurrent use under these conditions:

**Safe operations (no synchronization needed):**
- Concurrent solves (`sparse_lu_solve`, `sparse_cholesky_solve`) on the same factored matrix with different b/x vectors — solve is read-only on the matrix
- Concurrent factorization of different matrices — each has its own pool allocator
- Concurrent read-only access (nnz, get, matvec) to any matrix
- `sparse_errno()` — uses `_Thread_local` storage

**Unsafe operations (require external synchronization):**
- Concurrent mutation (insert/remove/factor) of the same matrix

**Optional mutex support:** Compile with `-DSPARSE_MUTEX` and `-pthread` to add per-matrix mutex locking on `sparse_insert()` and `sparse_remove()`. This serializes concurrent insert/remove calls on the same matrix. Factorization functions are NOT mutex-protected. Zero overhead when compiled without the flag.
