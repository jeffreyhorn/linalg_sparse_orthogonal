# Sprint 24 Day 8 — ND fill-quality close & document

## Decision

1. **Tighten `tests/test_reorder_nd.c::test_nd_10x10_grid_matches_or_beats_amd_fill`** from `nnz_nd ≤ 1.21× nnz_amd` (Sprint 23 Day 8 bound) to `nnz_nd ≤ 1.17× nnz_amd`.  Default-path achievement is bit-stable at 1.158× (760 / 656); the new bound has a 1.07pp safety margin (~7 nnz cushion).  All four `SPARSE_ND_COARSEN_FLOOR_RATIO × SPARSE_ND_SEP_LIFT_STRATEGY` env-var combinations produce identical 760 nnz_L on this fixture.
2. **Update `docs/algorithm.md` "Nested Dissection" subsection** to cite `SPARSE_ND_COARSEN_FLOOR_RATIO` (Day 5) under step 1 (Coarsen) and `SPARSE_ND_SEP_LIFT_STRATEGY` (Day 6) under step 4 (Vertex-separator extraction).  Also add a per-fixture advisory list under "Characteristics" that records the largest opt-in wins (Pres_Poisson ratio=200 → 0.942×; Kuu balanced_boundary → 1.415× / 38pp drop).  Drop the Sprint-23-era caveat that called out the 0.7× target as routed-to-Sprint-24 — this sprint closed item 2 (qg-AMD wall regression) but couldn't reach 0.85×; route both literal targets to Sprint 25.
3. **Capture Day-8 default-path Pres_Poisson ND wall time**: 42.86 s.  Above PLAN.md's "Sprint 23 baseline + 5 % drift" target (= 38.22 s); flagged but not failing — see "Wall-time observation" below for context.

## Background

Sprint 24 Day 8 was originally PLAN.md Day 11 ("ND Fill-Quality Follow-Up — Close & Document").  Per Day 1's (c)-revert + Day 5/Day 6/Day 7's pull-forward of items 5(a), 5(b), and 5 production-default work, Day 8 inherits the closing tasks from PLAN.md Day 11:

- Tighten the 10×10 grid bound to whatever Days 5-6's combined effect achieves on the 100-vertex fixture.
- Update `docs/algorithm.md` ND subsection to describe the new coarsening-floor + separator-extraction options.
- Run the full `tests/test_reorder_nd.c` + `tests/test_graph.c` under all combinations of the new env vars to confirm no test regresses.
- Capture Day-8 wall-time on Pres_Poisson ND under the new defaults.

## 10×10 grid sweep

Ran `build/test_reorder_nd` four times under each env-var combination.  Results were uniform:

| Setting (ratio, sep)               | nnz_amd | nnz_nd | ND/AMD |
|------------------------------------|--------:|-------:|-------:|
| default, smaller_weight            |     656 |    760 | 1.158× |
| default, balanced_boundary         |     656 |    760 | 1.158× |
| 200, smaller_weight                |     656 |    760 | 1.158× |
| 200, balanced_boundary             |     656 |    760 | 1.158× |

Why the env vars are no-ops on this fixture:

- **Coarsening floor** — n = 100, ratio = 100 → divisor-quotient = 1 < MAX-clamp = 20, so the coarsest level pegs at 20 vertices for any divisor in [1, 100000].  Same observation as Day 5's nos4 (n=100) and bcsstk14 (n=1806) sweeps.
- **Separator-lift strategy** — at the coarsest level (20 vertices), the brute-force bisection produces tight cuts where `boundary_count[0] == boundary_count[1]` reliably; balanced_boundary's tie-break converges to the same lift as smaller_weight's.

The achieved 1.158× is the cumulative effect of Sprint 23 Days 7 (leaf-AMD splice), 9-10 (gain-bucket FM), and 11 (multi-pass FM at the finest level) — not Sprint 24's env vars.  Sprint 23 Day 8 set the bound at 1.21× (1pp above the then-measured 1.20×); Day 11's 1.158× was never recorded in the bound.  Sprint 24 Day 8 catches up.

## Test bound tightening

`tests/test_reorder_nd.c::test_nd_10x10_grid_matches_or_beats_amd_fill`:

| Quantity                    | Value                                                       |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| AMD nnz(L) (deterministic)  | 656                                                         |
| ND nnz(L) (deterministic)   | 760                                                         |
| Measured ratio              | 1.158×                                                      |
| Old bound (Sprint 23 Day 8) | `nnz_nd ≤ 794` (1.21× — 34 nnz of headroom = 5pp)           |
| **New bound (Sprint 24 Day 8)** | `nnz_nd ≤ 767` (1.17× — 7 nnz of headroom = 1.07pp)     |

The partitioner is contractually deterministic (`tests/test_graph.c::test_partition_determinism_*`), so the ratio is bit-stable across runs.  Future commits that perturb the FM tie-breaks by more than 7 nnz on this fixture (~0.92 % drift) trip the gate and have to be evaluated explicitly.

## Cross-env-var ND + graph test sweep

Ran `build/test_reorder_nd` (12 tests / 52 assertions) and `build/test_graph` (39 tests / 1 460 assertions) under all four env-var combinations.  All tests pass under all four combinations:

| Setting                                  | test_reorder_nd     | test_graph         |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| default, smaller_weight                  | 12/12 (48.8 s)      | 39/39 (1.6 s)      |
| default, balanced_boundary               | 12/12 (50.7 s)      | 39/39 (1.6 s)      |
| 200, smaller_weight                      | 12/12 (40.0 s)      | 39/39 (1.6 s)      |
| 200, balanced_boundary                   | 12/12 (42.3 s)      | 39/39 (1.6 s)      |

Includes the `test_partition_determinism_*` contracts, the `test_edge_to_vertex_separator_smaller_side` pin (passes under balanced_boundary because the 5×6 grid's tied boundary counts and tied vertex weights both resolve to side 0 — strategies converge on this fixture), and the new tightened 10×10 / 0.96× Pres_Poisson bounds from Days 7-8.

## Wall-time observation

Day 8 captured Pres_Poisson default-path ND wall = **42.86 s** (`build/test_reorder_nd` stderr).  Comparison band:

| Day                 | Pres_Poisson ND wall | Source                                          |
|---------------------|---------------------:|-------------------------------------------------|
| Sprint 22 Day 14    |              ~44.0 s | `SPRINT_22/bench_day14.txt`                     |
| Sprint 23 Day 14    |              ~36.4 s | `SPRINT_23/bench_day14.txt` (post-Day-11 FM)    |
| Sprint 24 Day 5     |              ~35.5 s | `coarsen_floor_sweep_pres_poisson.txt` ratio=100 |
| Sprint 24 Day 6     |              ~37.5 s | `sep_strategy_sweep.txt` Setting A              |
| Sprint 24 Day 7     |              ~38.6 s | `nd_tuning_day7.md` "Wall-time spot-check"      |
| **Sprint 24 Day 8** |          **42.86 s** | `build/test_reorder_nd` Day-8 capture           |

PLAN.md Day 11 task 4's literal target was "Sprint 23 baseline + 5 % drift" (= 36.4 × 1.05 = 38.22 s); Day 8's measurement is 12.1 % above the Sprint 23 baseline.

Why this isn't a hard fail:

1. **No Sprint-24 algorithmic change touches the default ND path on Pres_Poisson.**  Days 5-6 added env-var-gated alternatives (off by default); Days 7-8 are test-bound + documentation work.  The default path is bit-identical to Sprint 23 Day 14 (verified by `nnz_nd = 2 541 734` matching the Sprint 23 capture).
2. **Run-to-run variability on this fixture is high.**  The 5 captures across Days 5-8 span 35.5 s → 42.86 s — a 21 % spread on the same code, same machine, same default-path settings.  The high-end captures land during periods of system load (concurrent clang-tidy / cppcheck during Day 8); the low-end captures are during quiet periods.  The 5 % drift threshold is unrealistic for this fixture given measured noise.
3. **`make wall-check` doesn't include Pres_Poisson ND wall** — it includes only Pres_Poisson AMD wall (the regression-prone path closed by Sprint 24 Day 2's revert).  Pres_Poisson ND wall is bench-tracked but not gated.

Sprint 25 plan input: if Pres_Poisson ND wall stability matters as a per-day gate, add a third `wall_check_baseline.txt` line for it with a wider 50% threshold rather than 2× (run-to-run variance is high enough that 2× is loose, but a 5% gate will fail constantly).

## docs/algorithm.md "Nested Dissection" subsection update

Cited the new env vars in the pipeline steps + added a per-fixture advisory list under "Characteristics".  Removed the Sprint-23-era caveat that flagged the 0.7× target as routed-to-Sprint-24; replaced with a Sprint-25 routing for both the 0.7× literal and the 0.85× stretch targets (per `nd_sep_strategy_decision.md` "Why option (b) misses the 0.85× target").

The updated section now reads:

- Step 1 (Coarsen) — cites `SPARSE_ND_COARSEN_FLOOR_RATIO`'s effect on Pres_Poisson (ratio=200 → 0.942×) and the regression bound (ratios ≥ 400 hit the floor and lose cut quality).
- Step 4 (Vertex-separator extraction) — cites `SPARSE_ND_SEP_LIFT_STRATEGY=balanced_boundary` and the 70/30 fallback gate, with the 8-38pp opt-in advisory for non-Pres_Poisson workloads.
- Characteristics — adds the per-fixture advisory list (Pres_Poisson ratio=200, Kuu/bcsstk14/nos4 balanced_boundary, plus the destructive-interaction note for Pres_Poisson combined).

The AMD subsection update (PLAN.md Day 13 task) is deferred to Day 9 (originally PLAN.md Day 13) — Day 8's scope is ND only.

## Day 9 plan reference

Day 9 (originally PLAN.md Day 12 — "Cross-Corpus Re-Bench"):

1. Run `benchmarks/bench_reorder.c` against the full SuiteSparse corpus (nos4, bcsstk04, Kuu, bcsstk14, s3rmt3m3, Pres_Poisson) with all five orderings (NONE / RCM / AMD / COLAMD / ND).  Capture to `docs/planning/EPIC_2/SPRINT_24/bench_day9.{csv,txt}`.
2. Run `benchmarks/bench_amd_qg.c` (qg vs bitset).  Capture to `bench_day9_amd_qg.{csv,txt}`.
3. Side-by-side compare against `SPRINT_22/bench_day14.txt` and `SPRINT_23/bench_day14.txt`.  Build a markdown table in `bench_summary_day9.md` showing nnz(L) and wall-time deltas per fixture × ordering across the three sprints.
4. Headline checks (Sprint 24's deliverable gates from PROJECT_PLAN.md item 6).

## Quality-gate notes

- `make format-check`: pending re-run on the Day 8 commit (test bound + comment edits + algorithm.md prose; expect clean).
- `make lint`: pending re-run; no new C-source edits, only test bound + comment.
- `make test`: ran `build/test_reorder_nd` + `build/test_graph` under all four env-var combinations (above); all 51 + 156 = 207 test invocations pass.  Full `make test` re-run pending.
- `make wall-check`: no kernel touched on Day 8; expect pass against the Day 4 baselines.
